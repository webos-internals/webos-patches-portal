Object Format:
	The Patch Object will just be a skeleton object with the patch id and name, and then have all the revisions linked to it.  The Revision object can link itself to a single older revision to show them as "equal" in terms of weight.  The Latest revision will always be the one used if there are any conflicts at all.  Revisions are inherently linear, and as such the older ones will be considered less important.  Each Revision and its aliases should at most have a single git tag between them.  Revisions should also not be seen by users, they should only be seen by power developers and people who want a much deeper understanding of how patches work.  Each Revision must have a patch file associated for it as well.
