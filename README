	Middle Layer:
		Unified API between top and bottom layers
	Bottom Layer (Backend):
		For git, mysql, user authentication, and related
		
	Top and Bottom layers should NEVER talk to each other directly.  All talk goes through middle layer to allow for changes in the top and bottom layers with no affect on other layers.
